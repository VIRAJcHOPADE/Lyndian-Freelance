              A <b>Control Tower App</b> can be so empowering. Esp. if you get
              to know just about everything you need to know at the start of the
              day. Meaningful, well-classified and actionable metrics that
              collectively convey just about everything re health of your
              business or function. About your own performance as a manager! At
              a glance. In less than 5 minutes. While driving to work. Makes for
              a productive day at work as usual. An app for supply chain
              manager, An App for finance head. An App for category manager. An
              app for Human Resources manager. An app for the CEO. It lends huge

            <p>That's a mouthful!</p>
            <p>
              But strictly speaking, very few implementation projects had
              cockpits and dashboards development as part of any large scale
              transformation initiatives. It was at best a lip service. 'Towards
              the end' thing. No cross functional treatment that it needs.
              Apparently very few managed to get the 'Dashboards' they wanted.
              The usual 'reporting sub-tracks' within a 'module' (esp. first
              time implementations) passed off as some sort of 'intelligence'
              requirements that respective managers had. Like summarized lists,
              a couple of statuses and occasionally an email notification of a
              critical situation like shipment delays made for all the
              intelligence they could consume. Occasionally some data
              maintenance utilities also passed off as 'intelligence'. If there
              is an expert BI consultant around, he would offer to 'design' just
              about every 'report' on BW. Incl ad-hoc lists that one could get
              on the fly from their ERP systems. Like sales to date by this geo
              and that category. Followed by a lecture on why you should not use
              ERP systems for generating reports! (these days they don't).
              Typically taking a month to build one from cryptic sounding data
              sources meant for implementation by discovery till you find a
              relevant one. Else build one from scratch. Thanks to
              documentation. Want another column or a new 'advanced' metric ?
              You engage him again. It is like a 10000$ affair per report esp.
              when there are half a dozen analysts taking a couple of weeks to
              decide the 'layout' to make it sound 'intelligible' enough for the
              demanding customer (Manager from a top B-School). And then they
              expected from the managers to login to so many systems to see so
              many things on a daily basis.{" "}

              Reports, KPIs and 'Analytics' in SAP was all over the place. ERP,
              BW, SCM, EPM, BPC.. CRM, SRM, Excel. No one single source met the
              needs of functional intelligence that discerning managers sought.

                What is the Supply Chain Organization of the firm? How are

                they expected to track trucks in transit (expected delivery

                <b>expected returns from the market.</b> That is a good proxy
                for how good is the quality of demand and supply plan. Typical
                formulation firms expect to keep it below 1.5%. Some call it
                inventory expiration risk. Anything above 2.5% means the whole

            <h4>How should you group the KPIs?</h4>
            <p>
              Every firm is unique. Culturally. What is important to them is not
              necessarily important for others. The language is different. The
              KPIs and 'formulas' are slightly different.
            </p>
            <h4>How should you separate the KPIs?</h4>
            <p>
              Keep a few KPIs confidential. Everyone need not know everything.
              Keep a few KPIs exclusively for the CEO. Nice to know is ok as
              long as you do not need to care.
            </p>
            <h4>How About Benchmark?</h4>
            <p>
              Internal 'ideal', last year, external, competition. Gartner top20.
            </p>
            <h4>How do you measure Manager's Performance?</h4>
            <p>
              Is it all about numbers? No human element? How do you know if
              managers took proactive decisions? How do you measure employee
              engagement ? Delegation? With report cards available on a minute
              by minute basis. What internal projects did the managers take to
              fix the root cause? or did the finance budget some monies towards
              such onetime project? Can the manufacturing head blame the
              customer supply chain manager for bad capacity utilization? High
              cost of production because of 'bad' production schedules? It is a
              chain reaction. One thing leading to another but you do what you
              do best. As long you can formulate the problem in context. In
              entirety. There is always a root cause.
            </p>

            <p>
              These are important questions. You can't always blame the Supply
              Chain Manager for shipment delays. You can't fire your 3PL for
              things out of his control. Like a broken truck or a transhipment
              delay awaiting another container ship.
